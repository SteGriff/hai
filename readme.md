# Hai

An email bot. Change the `config.php` file.  
It will send emails to a configured address for you. You can use it as the backend to a web form.

## Usage

POST to the bot's index page.

### Must have
`content` parameter

### Optional
`subject`  
`redirect` -- the page to redirect to after sending

## Downfalls

Currently no detection of failure to send.

## Cheers
